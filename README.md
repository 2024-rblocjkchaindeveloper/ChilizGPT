## Project Overview

***ChilizGPT*** is a highly trained assistant that provides in-depth insights about the Chiliz Blockchain and Get programming help and Access advanced AI analytics, detailed stats, predictive outcomes, and personalized insights about your favorite teams and players. It answers queries with precision, making complex Chiliz topics accessible to **newcomers, researchers, enthusiasts, and developers.** <br>

ChilizGPT assists developers in building dapps on the Chiliz Blockchain using the smart contract development, and Community to understand and get benefits from the Chiliz Products through a conversational UI, powered by **OpenAI Assistants, GPT-4o model, and the latest tech-stack.** <br>

It helps developers code, fix, and test their smart contracts to build web3 applications on Chiliz, and it helps the community todo AI-Powered Sports Analytics. Simply enter a prompt in the UI to get accurate answers. Specially designed for the Chiliz developers & community, ChilizGPT was developed by Asharib Ali as a submission for the **"Chiliz Sports Hackathon - Build For Passion"** <br>

## Problem Statement with Solution

Developers want to build on Chiliz but lack an interactive way to quickly and easily create full-stack web3 applications, and chiliz community want advanced AI analytics, detailed stats, predictive outcomes, and personalized insights about your favorite teams and players. They might use ChatGPT, but it's trained on outdated data and doesn't know about the latest developments. Plus, GPT Plus costs $20 per month. That's why we need a platform/chatbot to address this issue: "Help developers write, fix, and test their smart contracts & Community to understand and get benefits from the Chiliz Products for the Chiliz Blockchain" in a conversational way. I have trained it on a massive amount of Chiliz Ecosystem products data, and have prompt-engineered it to achieve the best results.

## Potential Integration

I have built two versions of the ChilizGPT, both have the same functionalities but one chatbot fixes in the full viewport of the screen and the other one is the pop-up version, both have the same functionality and are built with the same APIs, these chatbots can-be integrated into anywhere either on the complete subdomain of official website or the docs website but with the popup version.
